# HyperDeSci by LunCo

To urge space exploration LunCo is starting the initiative HyperDeSci with the final goal of summoning a web3 hyperstructure that would fuel DeSci project

To achieve LunCo's mission - building sustainable tourists settlement on the Moon - tons of technologies has to be created. 

And projects working on DeSci works on those technologies. 

## First HyperDeSci QF round 

1. Multichain - the round will be run simultaneously on several chains
2. Each chain has it's own matching fund, initially LunCo would support with $1000
3. LunCo would work on getting more funds and sponsors
4. Round dates: March 10 - April 1

### Eligibility criteria

Be serious DeSci project. 

LunCo team would propose general framework for future rounds, while for the first one the decision to accept the project would be made by LunCo team to save time and move fast

### Sponsorship

Sponsors who donate significant amount of money to matching pool would be highleghted during the round

### Apply to rounds

If you do not have project on Gitcoin you'll have to create it. [Guide](https://support.gitcoin.co/gitcoin-knowledge-base/gitcoin-grants-program/project-owners/how-to-create-a-project-in-builder)

We suggest to create a project on Optimism or Polygon chain as it's the cheapest chains, and it'll be easy to edit the project.

Once the project created you'll have to apply with it to all the rounds on all the chain. 

**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO RECREATE THE PROJECT ON ALL CHAINS, USE THE ONE YOU CREATED**

The easiest way to bridge money across chains to pay for gas for application is to use [MiniBridge by ChainEye](https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/invite/PUQPQ). We suggest to bridge at least $5 

1. zkSync
2. Scroll
3. Polygon
4. Optimism
5. Arbitrum

## Vision
Building unstoppable science machines! We're creating HyperStructures to fund DeSci projects that will change the world. Science to the moon! ðŸš€

## Current Status: $MEGAPI Launch ðŸš€
We're evolving from traditional QF rounds to a Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF) powered by the $MEGAPI token. This isn't just another token - it's a movement to revolutionize how science gets funded!

# xMEGAPI FURMION

Since the launch of xMEGAPI we’ve collected lots of feedback, and the main one: in the CCGF there has to be two different tokens \- one with governance power and the other for value distribution. 

That’s important to make the system sustainable as projects would have to sell coins that they’ve received to run their operations, leading to value loss resulting in shutting down the operations.

With that in mind we are proposing to launch a coin xMEGAPI $FURMION, get 5-10 projects on the StreamingQF round and distribute the grant funds over the course of 6 months.

Currently we have $1629 in [funding pool on Gardens](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/8453/0x7f8beda08fb7f1f3350d4be7f333f5a20f3247aa/0x96aa42ac2a15b897a12d736a28fbbc831f389d96/151) and \~$163 on our [Operations multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=celo:0x93da5340b7049fFf4a65e5C3146e709a594113c4), and for the $FURMION we are requesting $1000 USDGLO from the funding pool to launch the $FURMION coin

This phase of the initiative will be led by LunCo till the project will become mature enough (or die)

1. Treasury wallet \- requires ⅔ signatures \+ votes by xMEGAPI holder  
2. Operation wallet \- requires 1/3 and no governance, used by stewards for operations  
3. Management \- compensation for efforts to LunCo

## $FURMION

Furmion is a cat that funs science. We decided to use a character for the coin to make it more memetic. 

## Operations

As the LunCo team will run most of the operations with the help of stewards we mint a coin $FURMION using  [Clanker.world](http://clanker.world) v4 smart contract. 

## Fees structure

On Clanker it’s built in and not changeable that you mint 100B coins. Creator gets percent of trading fees, 1% default, clanker takes 20% from that

The rest are split:

1. 20% management fees  
2. 40% of fees goes to treasury multisig  
3. 40% are used to run operations multisig

## FURMION Minting

1. We mint a coin $FURMION  
2. Initial Market Cap 5 ETH  
3. DevBuy \- $1000 \- the coins that we gonna use for the round  
4. 15% vault, lockup period 60 days, no vesting, goes to treasury

It’ll result in

| DevShares | 6.67% |
| :---- | ----: |
| Dev Coins | 6,666,666,667 |

## Coinomics of DevCoins of $FURMION 

| Tokenomics of devbuy | Percent of devbuy | Total % | Numer of coins |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Streaming to projects | 30.0% | 2.00% | 2,000,000,000 |
| Rewards to xMEGAPI holders | 15.0% | 1.00% | 1,000,000,000 |
| Treasury | 19.0% | 1.27% | 1,266,666,667 |
| Operations \- marketing, incentives | 25.0% | 1.67% | 1,666,666,667 |
| Retro rewards for stewards | 5.0% | 0.33% | 333,333,333 |
| Retro for donors on Artizen | 4.0% | 0.27% | 266,666,667 |
| Retrorewards for supporters | 2.0% | 0.13% | 133,333,333 |
| **Total** | 100.0% | 6.67% |  |

## Projects selection

At this phase of the xMEGAPI summoning LunCo’s team would run the experiment, including on selection process, whom to accept to the SreamingQF round and how to run in. 

With time, when more people will get xMEGAPI and processes will be more established we will switch to the convictions voting as per CCGF

All the projects would have to sign the covenant that they pledge to reimburse the costs. 

## Airdrops distribution

Airdrops to xMEGAPI holders & Retro rewards to Steward to be distributed via Linear Streaming during 1 months period via Superfluid app

## Conclusion

Overall in 6-8 months we will have the results that would allow us to improve the operations, get results and so on. The main KPI:

1. How many projects funded  
2. How much funds distributed in $FURMION & USD  
3. How many donors  
4. Marketing results

Instead of distributing grants via Quadratic Funding Rounds on Gitcion we propose a continues Grants distribution framework via HyperDeSci distribution token while putting Grants into Liquidity Pool.




1. Grants -> Treasury -> Buy tokens from DEX
2. Token = can get portion of the treasury
3. Treasury is distributed via "StreamingQF", to start like week manual distribution
4. 
5. Voting = donating with money?
6. Staking on project = project eligibility, may be get some portion of tokens back to treasury?
7. Parameters:
	1. Portion of treasury distribution/rate - conviction voting from (0; 100] - conviction QF voting stake F(time)
	2. Max % per project, (0; 100] - conviction qf voting??? stake*F(time)
	3. Rate of burning some funds on staking

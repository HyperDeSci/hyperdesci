# Experiment Three: Conviction Voting & Grants Eligibility

## Overview
This experiment proposes a framework to accelerate early-stage DeSci projects, which are often the most promising but also the riskiest.

### Core Principles
1. **Convertible Grants**: Projects receiving grants pledge to replenish the treasury upon reaching maturity
2. **Decentralized Eligibility**: Through conviction voting
3. **Continuous Distribution**: Continuous grant distribution through Streaming QF

## Token Economics: $MEGAPI

### Initial Distribution
- Total Supply: 31,415,926,536 $MEGAPI (π × 10^6)
- Distribution Breakdown:
  - 20% (6.28B $MEGAPI) → Liquidity Pool with ~0.15 ETH from current treasury
  - 20% → StreamingQF distribution on course of 3 months
  - 10% → Early builder subsidies
  - 50% → Treasury reserve for future distribution

### Community Participation

To nominate a project for grants via Gardens, a citizen must:

- Entry Requirement: 10,000 $MEGAPI stake + 1,000 $MEGAPI treasury contribution

- Target: 50 initial members
  - Expected Total Stake: 500,000 $MEGAPI
  - Treasury Contribution: 50,000 $MEGAPI

### Treasury Sustainability
Projects receiving grants commit to treasury replenishment through:
- Direct treasury donations
- Adding liquidity pairs
- Other community-approved methods

## Implementation Process

1. **Citizenship Acquisition**
   - Stake 10,000 $MEGAPI
   - Contribute 1,000 $MEGAPI to treasury

2. **Project Creation**
   - Citizens can propose new projects
   - Projects must reach %ELIGIBILITY_THRESHOLD for grant consideration

3. **Grant Distribution**
   - Activation requires %MIN_PROJECTS (e.g., 5) reaching %ELIGIBILITY_THRESHOLD
   - Distribution methods:
     - Primary: StreamingQF
     - Alternative: Gardens voting system with QF integration

4. **Treasury Allocation**
   - Dedicated portions for:
     - Project grants
     - Marketing initiatives
     - Community development
     - Operational expenses

# Experiment Three: Conviction voting & Grants eligibility

**GET INVOLVED: [Telegram](https://t.me/hyperdesci_chat)**

Thx to Gardens HyperDeSci recieved some funds to run an experiment.

The goal of the experiment is to test a continues grants distribution mechanism for DeSci projects. 

It's highly inspired by the [Gardens Popup Commons Experiment](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/42161/0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548/0x0f143af46eef341b3f0dbf98c3ecb47f57067fef).

Some of the mechanisms being propsed in previous articles:
- [On continues grants distribution](./On%20Continues%20Grants%20distribution.md)
- [Sustaining HyperDeSci](./Sustaining%20HyperDeSci.md)
- [Thought on Token Engineering for HyperDeSci](./Thought%20on%20Token%20Engineering%20for%20HyperDeSci.md)

## Basic plan

1. Get citizenship by staking XX $YY tokens with ZZ% going to treasure (Could be as Popup commons: 20 ARB stake + 2 ARB to community)
2. Citizens would be able to create projects.
3. Once reached TT treshold project would be eligible for grants distribution.
4. Once PP projects (e.g. 5) reaches TT treshold, grants would be distributed.
5. Grants would be distributed via streaming QF, so once get enough conviction - project would get to the streamingqf round
6. Thou as Streaming QF is an experiment, maybe another way would be chosen - could be done via voting on gardens, with QF on gardens as an alternative to Streaming QF
7. It would be nice to explicitly dedicate a portion of the treasury to support activities like marketing, community building, etc.

# THE HYPERDESCI MANIFESTO

## WE ARE BUILDING THE SCIENCE COMMONS

We envision a world where scientific knowledge flows freely, researchers are fairly rewarded and supported with resources to focus on science, not bureaucracy.

## WHY WE EXIST

Traditional science funding is inefficient. We're building a community-driven alternative powered by $MEGAPI that:

- Supports researchers in real-time
- Returns value to the ecosystem when projects succeed
- We grow the pie (MEGAPI!) rather than fighting for slices

## OUR PRINCIPLES

**GIVE FIRST**
- We build public infrastructure to benefit humanity

**COMMUNITY OVER COMPETITION**
- We celebrate each other's breakthroughs


**SCIENCE IS THE PRODUCT**
- We measure success by scientific advancement and problems solved


## COMMUNITY GUIDELINES


1. **Stake in science** - Back researchers pushing knowledge boundaries
2. **Hold for impact** - Let tokens work for science, not short-term gains
3. **Contribute your skills** - All contributions advance our mission
4. **Vote with conviction** - Support projects that truly advance science
5. **Think generationally** - We're building for lasting impact


## SCIENTIFIC HYPERSTRUCTURE


We're creating a perpetual engine for science that can't be stopped, costs little to operate, creates immense value, and expands through network effects.

# Why HyperDeSci?

Science has revolutionized our world, but the funding mechanisms remain outdated and inefficient. Traditional grant applications, paywalled journals, and institutional gatekeeping hinder progress rather than promote it. 

Thanks to web3, we have superior methods to address these challenges.


## The Problem We're Solving

Scientists need sustainable funding to explore the universe's mysteries. Traditional funding models are plagued with inefficiencies, politics, and short-term thinking. Meanwhile, valuable research remains inaccessible behind expensive paywalls.

## Our Solution: Science as a Hyperstructure

We're building science funding as a "hyperstructure" – a crypto-economic protocol that runs forever without maintenance, cannot be stopped, and creates value for all participants. 

This means: Scientists receive continuous support rather than one-off grants

## How It Works

Our Continuous Convertible Grants framework operates on two simple principles:

1. **Community-Driven Selection via Conviction Voting**: Projects are selected for support based on sustained community conviction
2. **Fair Distribution**: Resources flow to projects proportionally to their community support, using StreamingQF to balance large and small backers

## The Beautiful Part

Scientists contribute value back to the ecosystem – but in ways that make sense for scientific progress. We don't demand immediate returns or force artificial metrics. Some research takes decades to bear fruit, and that's okay!

By supporting open science while respecting its unique timeline, HyperDeSci creates a sustainable ecosystem where knowledge flows freely and researchers can focus on what matters: unlocking the secrets of our universe.

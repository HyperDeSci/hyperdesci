Why HyperDeSci?

At HyperDeSci we are simply learning how our Universe works, and science is the most efficient way to do that known to humanity so far.

People who do science has to pay their bills and we are helping, but in a very web3 native way - "summoning a hyperstructure (http://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html)". 

Science must be free, but valuable and that's the idea behind hyperstructures.

Inspired by that ideas we've creaed a framework - Convertable Continues Grants framework, that's provides continues support, and is build on two pillars:

1. Conviction voting, aka voting in time to select initiative that will be supported
2. StreamingQF as the way to distribute value among supported projects

The supported projects would have to contribute value  back. 

We are not enforcing those contribution, and even the way how projects contribute back is very flexible. Why? Because it's really hard to assess the results of a research in a short term, as even reproducing researches could be v ery valuable, however very hard to access the contribution.

# Funding Experiments' Selection

CCGF aims to support various continuous funding mechanisms. To find the most effective approaches, the community will test different funding models through controlled experiments.

**Each funding experiment follows this process:**

1. A community member proposes a new funding model, specifying:
   * Allocation of **$MEGAPI** tokens for the test
   * Duration of the test period
   * Detailed description of the funding mechanism to be tested
2. Once the proposal receives sufficient support from ecosystem stakeholders (e.g., 33% of the staked **$MEGAPI** tokens), the funding experiment begins.
3. After launch, projects can apply to receive funding through this specific mechanism.

### First experiments

For example, a funding experiment might test:

1. **Streaming QF:** Real-time quadratic funding distribution
2. **Builder support:** Direct funding similar to [_Commons Protocol_](https://www.commonsprotocol.xyz/)
3. **Community staking:** Stake-weighted funding allocation

Suggestions are welcome.

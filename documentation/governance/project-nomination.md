# Project Nomination

1. Member of [_Gardens_](governance-participation/gardens.md) nominates a project by initiating a proposal and staking [**$MEGAPI**](../tokenomics/megapi/).
2. Once a project receives enough voting power from other members, the project is accepted to the experiment and funded according to the experiment parameters.

If the funded project violates the rules, the staking could be slashed.

# HyperStructure Properties

CCGF aims to become a true _HyperStructure_ for public goods funding. Let's analyze its current properties and areas for improvement:

### Current HyperStructure Properties

1. **Unstoppable**
   * Conviction voting ensures permissionless operation
   * Gardens framework provides decentralized governance
   * No central admin keys or pause functions
2. **Free (or very low cost)**
   * Only gas costs for interactions
   * No platform fees or administrative overhead
   * Minimal economic barriers to participation
3. **Valuable**
   * Treasury growth tied to ecosystem success
   * Value capture through token mechanics
   * Network effects from project collaboration
4. **Expansive**
   * Multiple funding experiments possible
   * Community-driven parameter adjustment
   * Cross-project pollination built-in

### Areas for Further Development

1. **Credible Neutrality**
   * _Current:_ Basic slashing mechanisms
   * _Future:_ More robust anti-gaming systems
   * **Goal:** Fully autonomous eligibility verification
2. **Perpetual Operation**
   * _Current:_ Relies on community maintenance
   * _Future:_ More automated treasury management, maybe even with AI
   * **Goal:** Self-sustaining economic model

These improvements will be developed through community governance and experimental funding mechanisms, moving CCGF closer to its ideal form as a true _HyperStructure_.

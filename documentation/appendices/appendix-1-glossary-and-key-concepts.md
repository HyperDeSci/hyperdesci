# Appendix 1: Glossary & Key Concepts

* **Public Goods**: Resources or services that benefit everyone and cannot be restricted (like clean air, scientific knowledge, or open-source software). They are "non-rivalrous" (one person's use doesn't reduce availability for others) and "non-excludable" (can't prevent people from using it).
* **HyperStructure**: A crypto-economic protocol that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption, or intermediaries. Key properties include being unstoppable, free, valuable, and expansive.
* **DeSci (Decentralized Science)**: Scientific research and funding conducted through decentralized _Web3_ technologies.
* **Quadratic Funding**: A matching mechanism where the matching amount increases with the number of contributors.
* **StreamingQF**: A continuous version of quadratic funding where support flows in real-time.
* **Gardens**: A decentralized governance framework that enables communities to coordinate around shared resources.
* **CCGF**: This framework -- Continuous Convertible Grants Framework.
* **Moloch**: A metaphor for coordination failures in society where individual incentives lead to collectively harmful outcomes.
*   **Multipolar Coordination Trap**: A situation where multiple actors, each acting in their own rational self-interest, create collectively suboptimal outcomes because they cannot effectively coordinate. Examples include:

    * **Arms races** where nations spend on weapons rather than social goods
    * **Environmental degradation** where companies pollute to stay competitive
    * **Research secrecy** where sharing would benefit all but each party holds back

    This is a key challenge that CCGF aims to address through aligned incentives and collaborative mechanisms.
* **DYOR**: _Do Your Own Research_.
* **Slashing**: A mechanism to penalize projects for violating rules, typically by reducing their staked tokens.
* **Staking**: The act of locking up tokens to support a project or mechanism, typically to earn rewards or influence decision-making.
* **Conviction Voting**: A voting system where the weight of a vote decreases over time, encouraging long-term commitment.
* **Treasury**: The treasury of the **HyperDeSci** ecosystem, holding **$MEGAPI** tokens and other ecosystem tokens.

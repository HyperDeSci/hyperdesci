# The Vision

**Public goods**—from open-source software to scientific research output—form the foundation of human progress. Yet there's a lack of sustainable funding mechanisms that support public goods at a level matching their importance. Traditional funding models are plagued by inefficiency, misaligned incentives, and unsustainable economics. We believe that the future of public goods funding isn't in discrete grants or centralized decision-making—it's in continuous, community-driven support systems that align incentives for long-term sustainability.

To bridge the gap to sustainable funding of public goods, we propose a new paradigm: the **Continuous Convertible Grants Framework** (CCGF).

## Core Innovation

#### Key differentiators

* **Continuous Funding**: Unlike grant rounds with fixed windows, CCGF streams support in real-time.
* **Convertible Returns**: Successful projects repay or share success back to the treasury, fueling future projects.
* **Low-Attention Governance**: Powered by conviction voting, limiting the need for constant oversight.
* **Robust Slashing Mechanisms**: Projects that fail to meet obligations or break rules risk losing staked tokens.
* **Aligned Incentives**: Ecosystem token staking ensures that the community and funded projects share both risk and reward.

#### Key principles

1. **Collaborative Growth First**
   * Give before taking
   * Honor commitments
   * Practice sustainable sharing
   * Grow as a community
2. **Build for Perpetual Value**
   * Design systems that compound benefits over time
   * Create supermodular games where collaboration multiplies value
3. **Automate for Public Good**
   * Leverage AI for automation
   * Build self-sustaining [_HyperStructures_](../appendices/appendix-3-hyperstructure-properties.md)
   * Enable _Universal Basic Income_ (UBI)
4. **Prioritize Public Goods**
   * Focus on collective benefits
   * Create shared resources and infrastructure
5. **Enable Coordinated Progress**
   * Overcome coordination failures (_Moloch_)
   * Solve multipolar traps through intentional cooperation
6. **Impact Over Token Price**
   * Prioritize scientific and social impact
   * Measure success through the advancement of public goods
   * Focus on long-term value creation over short-term token appreciation

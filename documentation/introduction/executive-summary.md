# Executive Summary

This framework describes a perpetual grants mechanism for _decentralized science_ (**DeSci**).

**With CCGF:**

* Projects receive continuous, real-time funding rather than discrete grants.
* Convertible returns from successful projects flow back to the treasury.
* Slashing mechanisms deter misuse of funds and maintain fairness.
* Governance is handled through [_Gardens_](../governance/governance-participation/gardens.md)-based conviction voting to ensure low-attention, decentralized decision-making.
* [**$MEGAPI**](../tokenomics/megapi.md) token aligns incentives between projects and the wider ecosystem.

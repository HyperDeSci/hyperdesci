**UPD: July 2025** 
Since launch we received lot's of feedback about the system and in the [vote on Gardens](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/8453/0x7f8beda08fb7f1f3350d4be7f333f5a20f3247aa/0x96aa42ac2a15b897a12d736a28fbbc831f389d96/151/0x8fe008e79f1f66453865e611224d66ad4cb536aa-1) made a decision to experiment with two token system - one for voting for projects xMEGAPI, and another one to distribute value - $FURMION memecoin.

Once the proposal passes LunCo team would handle operations to run Furmion.

The documents will be updated later to reflect the new two-token system, if you have questions - join our [Telegram](https://t.me/hyperdesci_chat)

## A self-sustaining engine for public goods funding

This document describes an experimental framework for sustainable public goods funding, specifically designed to support [_decentralized science_](https://ethereum.org/en/desci/) (**DeSci**) projects.

The **Continuous Convertible Grants Framework** (CCGF) aims to become a [_HyperStructure_](https://jacob.energy/hyperstructures.html)â€”an unstoppable, free, valuable, and expansive system that can perpetually support scientific advancement.

Inspired by successful mechanisms like [_Quadratic Funding_](https://www.wtfisqf.com/), [_StreamingQF_](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/streaming-quadratic-funding), and [_Gardens_](https://www.gardens.fund/), CCGF represents an evolution of these approaches designed to create greater impact across the **DeSci ecosystem**.

If you are new to [_Web3_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] and these terms, we suggest reading [**Appendix 1: Glossary & Key Concepts**](appendices/appendix-1-glossary-and-key-concepts.md) first.

This is an evolving experiment, starting with the launch of [**$MEGAPI**](tokenomics/megapi/) token and [_Gardens_-based governance](governance/governance-participation/gardens.md).

:bangbang: **WARNING:** As with any experimental framework, there are risks involved, and lots of missing pieces will be determined through the governance process. Please read [**Appendix 2: Risk Factors**](appendices/appendix-2.md) before participating.

# Pre-token

As we start our operations, it’s hard to envision all aspects related to governance and grant allocation mechanics. Still, there was a need to get our feet wet and obtain the empirical data to fully understand the processes we currently only have on paper.

Since we’d rather have an option to have a smart contract custom-tailored to our use case down the line, we decided to launch a generic placeholder test token (**$xMEGAPI**) first, that we would use for testing out our procedures, instead of **$MEGAPI**.

Following the token generation event (TGE), **$MEGAPI** will be airdropped to **$xMEGAPI** holders in a 1:1 ratio.

**UPD: July 2025** 
Since launch we received lot's of feedback about the system and in the [vote on Gardens](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/8453/0x7f8beda08fb7f1f3350d4be7f333f5a20f3247aa/0x96aa42ac2a15b897a12d736a28fbbc831f389d96/151/0x8fe008e79f1f66453865e611224d66ad4cb536aa-1) made a decision to experiment with two token system - one for voting for projects xMEGAPI, and another one to distribute value - $FURMION memecoin.

Once the proposal passes LunCo team would handle operations to run Furmion.

The documents will be updated later to reflect the new two-token system, if you have questions - join our [Telegram](https://t.me/hyperdesci_chat)

## THE VISION

**HyperDeSci** is creating a self-sustaining ecosystem for funding scientific research. Unlike traditional grants that provide one-time funding, our **Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF)** creates an ongoing funding stream while encouraging successful initiatives to give back to the ecosystem.

## THE PROBLEM

Science funding is broken. Traditional models are:
- Slow and bureaucratic
- Limited to discrete, one-time grants
- Missing sustainable feedback loops
- Excluding most potential supporters

## OUR SOLUTION

We're building a revolutionary funding system that is:
- **Continuous** - projects receive real-time funding streams
- **Convertible** - successful projects contribute back
- **Community-Driven** - decisions made through low-attention governance
- **Self-Sustaining** - creating a positive-sum funding ecosystem

   - Potential ecosystem growth benefits

2. **For Projects**
   - Continuous rather than one-time funding

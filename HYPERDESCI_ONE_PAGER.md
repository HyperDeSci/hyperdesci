# HyperDeSci: Continuous Convertible Grants for Science

![HyperDeSci Header](diagrams/hyperdesci_header.svg)

---

## THE VISION

**HyperDeSci** is creating a self-sustaining ecosystem for funding scientific research. Unlike traditional grants that provide one-time funding, our **Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF)** creates an ongoing funding stream while encouraging successful initiatives to give back to the ecosystem.

## THE PROBLEM

Science funding is broken. Traditional models are:
- Slow and bureaucratic
- Limited to discrete, one-time grants
- Missing sustainable feedback loops
- Excluding most potential supporters

## OUR SOLUTION

We're building a revolutionary funding system that is:
- **Continuous** - projects receive real-time funding streams
- **Convertible** - successful projects contribute back
- **Community-Driven** - decisions made through low-attention governance
- **Self-Sustaining** - creating a positive-sum funding ecosystem

   - Potential ecosystem growth benefits

2. **For Projects**
   - Continuous rather than one-time funding
   - Community support and collaboration

# Continues Convertable Grants Framework Whitepaper

## Abstract

Public goods are good, the more experiments the better. We are proposing yet another approach:
- focus on sustainability for donors, projects, treasury
- Continiues in time
- Convertable grants - projects pledge to somehow reimburse 

Possible experinments:
- Dedicate some tokens to streaming QF
- Dedicate some tokens for builders with community screaning voting

## Introduction

While Gitcoin popularised quadratic funding, and projects like Octant does great things, thier round-like appriach has several weak points.

With the proposed process we are planning to tackle thouse newances :
1. A lot of projects are doing impact continuesly, and they to pay bills on a reqular basis
2. Projects, that's already passed screaning apply to grants again and again introducing overheads as they would have to be checked for eligibility
3. Selecting keepers who checks projects for each round could create biases
4. Projects have nothing on stake, preventing them from doing Sybil like attacks

## The process

1. To join governance participants would have to stake 
2. They'll be able to propose experiments how to use treasury to support public goods
3. To address eligibility every project willing to get support would have to:
- find someone who will make a proposal to support project
- take a pledge to volunterly reimburse costs in some form or another once mature
- if project would be found violating the rules e.g. quid pro quo in StreamingQF stake of the guy who proposed slashes and goes to community pool
4. All the experiments and voting systems should be tuned for on-going operations, like relying on conviction voting for eligibility

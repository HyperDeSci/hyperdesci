# Continuous Convertible Grants Framework Whitepaper

## Abstract

The Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF) is a yet another approach to sustainable funding for public goods, combining:

1. Continuous funding through streaming mechanisms
2. Convertible grants that align incentives
3. Community-driven governance

Key innovations:
- Replaces discrete funding rounds with continuous streaming
- Uses convertible grant pledges for treasury sustainability
- Relies on conviction voting for decentralized decisions

## 1. Introduction

Rather than relying on mandatory taxation and centralized allocation, CCGF creates a voluntary system where:
- Funders are incentivized to support valuable initiatives through matching mechanisms
- Builders (whether public goods developers, NGOs, scientists, or startups) commit to sustainable development through convertible grant pledges
- Communities self-govern with minimal ongoing time commitment via mechanisms like conviction voting

This represents a novel approach to the age-old challenge of funding socially valuable projects - one that harnesses the power of web3 to create more efficient and sustainable funding mechanisms for public goods, NGOs, scientific research, and early-stage innovation.


Inspired by hyperstructures, quadratic funding, streamingqf, we propose a new approach to funding public goods.

at it's core the idea is to distribute token tied to matching pool instead of giving grants directly

### 1.1 Current Challenges
- Public goods, NGOs, early projects need continuous funding for ongoing operations
- Repeated eligibility checks create overheads from both sides - grant operators and projects, while most of projects are same from round to round 
- Centralized keeper selection as with gitcoin, octant, etc introduces bias
- Limited accountability for funded projects as they have nothing on stake
- While there are plenty of mechanism to distribte funds, very few are sustainable. Simply speaking once treasury ends, so does the funding and prjects stops.

### 1.2 Core Principles
- Sustainability for all participants (donors, projects, treasury)
- Continuous rather than discrete funding
- Aligned incentives through convertible grants
- Community-driven governance
- Cultural covenant for ecosystem growth

### 1.3 Design Philosophy
- Built as a HyperStructure - runs forever without maintenance
- Combines proven mechanisms (StreamingQF, Gardens, Covenants)
- Focus on cultural alignment and mutual support
- Progressive decentralization through community governance

### 1.4 Core Mechanisms

### Continuous Streaming
- Projects receive continuous funding based on community support
- Streaming QF replaces discrete funding rounds
- Reduces administrative overhead and funding gaps

### Convertible Grants
- Projects pledge to replenish treasury upon success
- Methods include:
  - Direct treasury contributions
  - Liquidity provision
  - Token allocations
- Voluntary nature maintains alignment

### Conviction Voting
- Community members stake tokens to participate
- Vote weight increases with time (conviction)
- Used for:
  - Project eligibility
  - Parameter adjustments
  - Treasury allocations

## 1.5 Foundational Inspirations

### HyperStructures
Inspired by Jacob's HyperStructures principles:
- Unstoppable: Once deployed, runs perpetually
- Free: Extremely low/zero cost to use
- Valuable: Accrues value that can be captured by token holders
- Expansive: Positive-sum value creation for ecosystem participants

### Quadratic Funding
Building on Gitcoin's QF innovations:
- Democratic allocation of funds
- Amplification of small donors
- Community-driven prioritization
- Anti-sybil mechanisms

### StreamingQF
Incorporating Geo Web's StreamingQF concepts:
- Continuous rather than discrete funding
- Real-time fund distribution
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Dynamic reallocation based on support

### Gardens (1Hive)
Adapting Gardens' governance mechanisms:
- Conviction voting for stable decision making
- Community-driven proposal process
- Covenant-based cultural alignment
- Progressive decentralization

### Key Synthesis
CCGF combines these elements into a novel framework:
1. HyperStructure-style perpetual operation
2. StreamingQF for continuous distribution
3. Gardens-style governance and culture
4. Convertible grants for sustainability

This synthesis creates several key improvements:
- Continuous vs discrete funding rounds
- Built-in treasury sustainability mechanisms
- Cultural alignment through covenants
- Reduced administrative overhead
- Community-driven governance

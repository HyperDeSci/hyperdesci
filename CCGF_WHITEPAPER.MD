# Continuous Convertible Grants Framework
## A Self-Sustaining Engine for Public Goods Funding

This document describes an experimental framework for sustainable public goods funding, specifically designed to support decentralized science (DeSci). The Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF) aims to become a HyperStructure - an unstoppable, free, valuable, and expansive system that can perpetually support scientific advancement.

Inspired by successful mechanisms like Quadratic Funding, StreamingQF, and Gardens, CCGF introduces continuous funding streams, convertible grants, and cultural alignment to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for DeSci projects.

This is an evolving experiment, starting with the launch of $MEGAPI token and Gardens-based governance.

The future of public goods funding isn't in discrete grants or centralized decision-making - it's in continuous, community-driven support systems that align incentives for long-term sustainability.

## The Vision

Public goods - from open-source software to scientific research - form the foundation of human progress. Yet we've failed to create sustainable funding mechanisms that match their importance. Traditional funding models are plagued by inefficiency, misaligned incentives, and unsustainable economics.

We propose a new paradigm: The Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF).

## Core Innovation

CCGF replaces traditional grant-making with a perpetual funding engine built on three key principles:

1. **Continuous Over Discrete**
   - Projects receive uninterrupted funding streams
   - Support adjusts in real-time based on community conviction
   - No more artificial funding cycles or grant rounds

2. **Aligned Incentives**
   - Projects stake tokens to participate
   - Successful projects contribute back to the treasury
   - Value captured flows to ecosystem participants

3. **Low-Attention Governance**
   - Conviction voting replaces constant decision-making
   - Community sets direction through passive signaling

## The Mechanism

At its core, CCGF uses a token-tied matching pool instead of direct grants:

1. Treasury holds ecosystem tokens
2. Projects receive continuous token streams via different experimental funding mechanisms
3. Success drives token value
4. Value flows back to treasury through convertible mechanisms
5. Project can by punished for violating rules by slashing staking of proposers, or use other similar mechanisms

This creates a flywheel effect:
- More projects → More value creation → Higher token value → Larger treasury → More projects

## Implementation: HyperDeSci Experiment Three: $MEGAPI

To test the ideas in practice, we will launch a new experimental funding mechanism called $MEGAPI.

- Initial Treasury: pi*10^6 $MEGAPI (18 digits)
- Current HyperDeSci Treasury: 0.15 ETH

### How to participate in Gardens

1. For governance join Gardens (link tbd)
2. Sign the ecosystem covenant
3. Stake $MEGAPI tokens
   - min 1k $MEGAPI tokens
   - 10% staked $MEGAPI goes to treasury

### General eligibility selection process

1. Member of Gardens should nominate the project by staking $MEGAPI tokens
2. If project violates the rules, the staking could be slashed
3. Once project recieves enogh voting power the project will be accepted to funding experiment.

### Funding experiments selection

There are different continues funding mechanisms, and community would experiment with different mechanisn. 

The general process is something:
1. Community member should propose the experiment:
2. How many $MEGAPI tokens should be allocated to the experiment
3. How long the experiment should last
4. What is the mechanism of the experiment

Once community accepts, e.g. 33% percent of the staked $MEGAPI tokens, the experiment will be launched.
After that projects would be able to apply for funding.  

### First experiments

We propose these experiments, new once are much welcome.
1. Streaming QF
2. Builder support like on commons protocol
3. Community staking

## HyperStructure Properties

CCGF aims to become a true HyperStructure for public goods funding. Let's analyze its current properties and areas for improvement:

### Current HyperStructure Properties

1. **Unstoppable**
   - Conviction voting ensures permissionless operation
   - Gardens framework provides decentralized governance
   - No central admin keys or pause functions

2. **Free (or very low cost)**
   - Only gas costs for interactions
   - No platform fees or administrative overhead
   - Minimal economic barriers to participation

3. **Valuable**
   - Treasury growth tied to ecosystem success
   - Value capture through token mechanics
   - Network effects from project collaboration

4. **Expansive**
   - Multiple funding experiments possible
   - Community-driven parameter adjustment
   - Cross-project pollination built-in

### Areas for Further Development

1. **Credible Neutrality**
   - Current: Basic slashing mechanisms
   - Future: More robust anti-gaming systems
   - Goal: Fully autonomous eligibility verification

2. **Perpetual Operation**
   - Current: Relies on community maintenance
   - Future: More automated treasury management, maybe even with AI
   - Goal: Self-sustaining economic model

These improvements will be developed through community governance and experimental funding mechanisms, moving CCGF closer to its ideal form as a true HyperStructure.

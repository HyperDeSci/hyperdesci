# Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (draft)
## A Self-Sustaining Engine for Public Goods Funding

This document describes an experimental framework for sustainable public goods funding, specifically designed to support decentralized science (DeSci). The Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF) aims to become a HyperStructure - an unstoppable, free, valuable, and expansive system that can perpetually support scientific advancement.

Inspired by successful mechanisms like Quadratic Funding, StreamingQF, and Gardens, CCGF introduces continuous funding streams, convertible grants, and cultural alignment to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for DeSci projects.

This is an evolving experiment, starting with the launch of $MEGAPI token and Gardens-based governance.

## Executive Summary
This framework describes a perpetual grants mechanism for decentralized science (DeSci). With CCGF:
- Projects receive continuous, real-time funding rather than discrete grants.
- Convertible returns from successful projects flow back to the treasury.
- Slashing mechanisms deter misuse of funds and maintain fairness.
- Governance is handled through Gardens-based conviction voting to ensure low-attention, decentralized decision-making.
- $MEGAPI token aligns incentives between projects and the wider ecosystem.

The future of public goods funding isn't in discrete grants or centralized decision-making - it's in continuous, community-driven support systems that align incentives for long-term sustainability.

## The Vision

Public goods - from open-source software to scientific research - form the foundation of human progress. Yet we've failed to create sustainable funding mechanisms that match their importance. Traditional funding models are plagued by inefficiency, misaligned incentives, and unsustainable economics.

We propose a new paradigm: The Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF).

### Key Differentiators of CCGF
- **Continuous Funding**: Unlike grant rounds with fixed windows, CCGF streams support in real-time.
- **Convertible Returns**: Successful projects repay or share success back to the treasury, fueling future projects.
- **Low-Attention Governance**: Powered by conviction voting, limiting the need for constant oversight.
- **Robust Slashing Mechanisms**: Projects that fail to meet obligations or break rules risk losing staked tokens.
- **Aligned Incentives**: $MEGAPI staking ensures that the community and funded projects share both risk and reward.

## Key principles

1. Collaborative Growth First
   - Give before taking
   - Honor commitments
   - Practice sustainable sharing
   - Grow as a community

2. Build for Perpetual Value
   - Design systems that compound benefits over time
   - Create supermodular games where collaboration multiplies value

3. Automate for Public Good
   - Leverage AI for automation
   - Build self-sustaining HyperStructures
   - Enable Universal Basic Income

4. Prioritize Public Goods
   - Focus on collective benefits
   - Create shared resources and infrastructure

5. Enable Coordinated Progress
   - Overcome coordination failures (Moloch)
   - Solve multipolar traps through intentional cooperation

6. Impact Over Token Price
   - Prioritize scientific and social impact
   - Measure success through advancement of public goods
   - Focus on long-term value creation over short-term token appreciation

## Core Innovation

CCGF replaces traditional grant-making with a perpetual funding engine built on three key principles:

1. **Continuous Over Discrete**
   - Projects receive uninterrupted funding streams
   - Support adjusts in real-time based on community conviction
   - No more artificial funding cycles or grant rounds

2. **Aligned Incentives**
   - Projects stake tokens to participate
   - Successful projects contribute back to the treasury
   - Value captured flows to ecosystem participants

3. **Low-Attention Governance**
   - Conviction voting replaces constant decision-making
   - Community sets direction through passive signaling

## The Mechanism

At its core, CCGF uses a token-tied matching pool instead of direct grants:

1. Treasury holds ecosystem tokens
2. Projects receive continuous token streams via different experimental funding mechanisms
3. Success drives token value
4. Value flows back to treasury through convertible mechanisms
5. Project can by punished for violating rules by slashing staking of proposers, or use other similar mechanisms

This creates a flywheel effect:
- More projects → More value creation → Higher token value → Larger treasury → More projects


## Implementation: HyperDeSci Experiment Three: $MEGAPI

To test the ideas in practice, we will launch a new experimental funding mechanism called $MEGAPI.

- Total Supply: π * 10^6 $MEGAPI
- Current HyperDeSci Treasury: 0.15 ETH
- Token Utility:
  - Governance rights
  - Grant participation

### How to participate in Gardens

1. For governance join Gardens (link tbd)
2. Sign the ecosystem covenant
3. Stake $MEGAPI tokens
   - min 1k $MEGAPI tokens
   - 10% staked $MEGAPI goes to treasury

### Governance Framework
1. Proposal Types:
   - Funding experiments
   - Parameter adjustments
   - Treasury management
   - Framework improvements

2. Voting Process:
   - Conviction voting with time-weighted voting power
   - Minimum voting period: [X] days

3. Proposal Requirements:
   - Detailed impact assessment
   - Clear success metrics
   - Risk analysis

### General eligibility selection process

1. Member of Gardens should nominate the project by staking $MEGAPI tokens
2. If project violates the rules, the staking could be slashed
3. Once project recieves enogh voting power the project will be accepted to funding experiment.

### Project Evaluation Criteria
1. Impact Metrics:
   - Scientific/technical merit
   - Community benefit
   - Open-source commitment
   - Collaboration potential

2. Reporting Requirements:
   - Regular progress updates
   - Open documentation
   - Community engagement metrics
   - Resource utilization reports

### Funding experiments selection

There are different continues funding mechanisms, and community would experiment with different mechanisn. 

The general process is something:
1. Community member should propose the experiment:
2. How many $MEGAPI tokens should be allocated to the experiment
3. How long the experiment should last
4. What is the mechanism of the experiment

Once community accepts, e.g. 33% percent of the staked $MEGAPI tokens, the experiment will be launched.
After that projects would be able to apply for funding.  

### First experiments

We propose these experiments, new once are much welcome.
1. Streaming QF
2. Builder support like on commons protocol
3. Community staking

## HyperStructure Properties

CCGF aims to become a true HyperStructure for public goods funding. Let's analyze its current properties and areas for improvement:

### Current HyperStructure Properties

1. **Unstoppable**
   - Conviction voting ensures permissionless operation
   - Gardens framework provides decentralized governance
   - No central admin keys or pause functions

2. **Free (or very low cost)**
   - Only gas costs for interactions
   - No platform fees or administrative overhead
   - Minimal economic barriers to participation

3. **Valuable**
   - Treasury growth tied to ecosystem success
   - Value capture through token mechanics
   - Network effects from project collaboration

4. **Expansive**
   - Multiple funding experiments possible
   - Community-driven parameter adjustment
   - Cross-project pollination built-in

### Areas for Further Development

1. **Credible Neutrality**
   - Current: Basic slashing mechanisms
   - Future: More robust anti-gaming systems
   - Goal: Fully autonomous eligibility verification

2. **Perpetual Operation**
   - Current: Relies on community maintenance
   - Future: More automated treasury management, maybe even with AI
   - Goal: Self-sustaining economic model

These improvements will be developed through community governance and experimental funding mechanisms, moving CCGF closer to its ideal form as a true HyperStructure.

## Appendix 1: Glossary & Key Concepts

Before diving deeper, let's clarify some key terms:

- **Public Goods**: Resources or services that benefit everyone and cannot be restricted (like clean air, scientific knowledge, or open-source software). They are "non-rivalrous" (one person's use doesn't reduce availability for others) and "non-excludable" (can't prevent people from using it)

- **HyperStructure**: A crypto-economic protocol that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption, or intermediaries. Key properties include being unstoppable, free, valuable, and expansive

- **DeSci (Decentralized Science)**: Scientific research and funding conducted through decentralized web3 technologies

- **Quadratic Funding**: A matching mechanism where the matching amount increases with the number of contributors

- **StreamingQF**: A continuous version of quadratic funding where support flows in real-time

- **Gardens**: A decentralized governance framework that enables communities to coordinate around shared resources

- **CCGF**: This framework - Continuous Convertible Grants Framework

- **Moloch**: A metaphor for coordination failures in society where individual incentives lead to collectively harmful outcomes

- **Multipolar Coordination Trap**: A situation where multiple actors, each acting in their own rational self-interest, create collectively suboptimal outcomes because they cannot effectively coordinate. Examples include:
  - Arms races where nations spend on weapons rather than social goods
  - Environmental degradation where companies pollute to stay competitive
  - Research secrecy where sharing would benefit all but each party holds back
  This is a key challenge that CCGF aims to address through aligned incentives and collaborative mechanisms.

- **DYOR**: Do Your Own Research

### Appendix 2: Risk Factors

Participants should be aware that:
1. Cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks
2. The CCGF mechanism is experimental
3. Token values can fluctuate significantly
4. Smart contracts may contain undiscovered vulnerabilities
5. Regulatory environment remains uncertain

All participants acknowledge these risks when joining the ecosystem. The project team is not liable for any losses. Do your own research.

### Technical Risk Mitigation
- Smart contract audit plan
- Bug bounty program
- Emergency response procedures

### Economic Risk Mitigation
- Treasury diversification strategy
- Grant recipient vesting schedules
- Slashing conditions and process

### Governance Risk
- Reduced through transparent, on-chain voting and time-weighted conviction mechanisms

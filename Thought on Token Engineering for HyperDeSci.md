*DeSci is a social activity by DeScientist* 

# Introduction

It feels natural for HyperDeSci to rely on kind of a governance token to decentralize internal operations in a democratic and efficient way and create a sustainable ecosystem that growth with the growth of projects

## Entities

1. HyperDeSci treasury - source of funding for projects
2. Projects - DeSci projects
3. Contributors - people who does something tangible for HyperDeSci community
4. Backers - people who support projects on different activities with funds
5. Sponsors - entities who provide funds to treasury to be distributed
# Goals

1. Provide DeSci projects with resources to achieve their goals
2. Compensate contributors efforts who sustain HyperDeSci operations
3. Decentralize decision making
4. Sustain value distribution among entities to allow the growth of the ecosystem
# Ideas

1. Conviction voting for/against  project being identified as a DeSci and valuable for the ecosystem. In most cases once the project is defined as DeSci it would be an overhead to review the project again, thou with time the project could pivot or stop operations, so both for/against voting is needed
2. Streaming QF to distribute value as projects need funds on an ongoing basis to operate
3. Use augmented bounding curve with taxation allowing various ways of acquiring tokens
4. Incentive projects to contribute back to the ecosystem
5. Experiment with different value distribution mechanism like:
	- Running QF rounds on Gitcoin
	- Run streaming QF initiatives
	- Direct grants/other funding strategies on Allo protocol


# Opportunities

1. HyperDeSci on Giveth
2. Giveth Q/acc initiative
3. Getting sponsors

# Who did contribution

1. Sponsors of previous DeSci rounds on Gitcoin e.g. Public nouns, MoonDAO, Global Chinise Community
2. Backers of previous rounds


# Questions

1. How to fairly kickstart the token?
2. Tokenomics?
3. How to reward initial contributors?

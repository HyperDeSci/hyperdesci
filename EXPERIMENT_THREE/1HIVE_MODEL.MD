# Overview of 1HIVE

Based on [1Hive Gardens v2 Community](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/100/0x71850b7e9ee3f13ab46d67167341e4bdc905eef9/0xe2396fe2169ca026962971d3b2e373ba925b6257)

## Covenant
### Purpose:
1Hive is a community of activists seeking to build a future that is more free, fair, open, and humane. The goal of the 1Hive protocol is to foster a healthy community economy by allocating a steady stream of Honey towards development, maintenance, and improvement of the common goods that bring the most value to the 1Hive community. The growth of the 1Hive economy is directly related to the communities ability to foster an inclusive and welcoming culture that people feel proud and delighted to adopt as their own. When someone chooses to buy or hold Honey and participate in the Honey economy they are implicitly supporting the communities culture, values, and norms. To this end, the 1Hive protocol depends on a social contract, which sets expectations for how members should engage both with the protocol and with one another.

### Pledge:
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Code of Conduct:
#### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people

Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

#### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

Public or private harassment

Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Membership:
1Hive is an open community - welcoming anyone to join and participate in our collective. The requirements for joining are:

#### Initiation:
Agree to abide by the terms of this Covenant with an on-chain signature upon registration in the Community.

#### Stake:
Stake the required amount of Honey tokens upon registration in the Community.

### Council:
The Council is a Safe address that serves as a moderator for the Community. The Council has limited administrative permissions including the ability to create Pools, update settings and parameters in Pool, and manage settings in the Community.

### Tribunal:
The Tribunal is a Safe address that serves as the Community's judicial arm, ruling on disputed transactions in the Community to determine whether a violation of this Covenant occurred.

### Enforcement:
The terms of this Covenant are enforced with a combination of onchain and off-chain actions.

#### Onchain:
Administrative actions executed by the Council Safe to advance this Covenant, and Judicial rulings made by the Tribunal Safe to uphold this Covenant are both executed onchain and enforced by smart contracts on a distributed ledger.

#### Off-chain:
While there is no canonical off-chain forum that represents the 1Hive community, there are community spaces including the 1Hive GitHub, Discourse, and Discord communities, and others forums which may emerge in the future which are expected to adhere to this covenant.

### Scope:
This iteration of the 1Hive Community on Gardens v2 is built by a group of active contributors in 1Hive looking to advance the capabilities of the Community beyond what's currently available in Gardens v1. Since Dynamic Issuance of the Honey token still runs on 1Hive's v1 Garden, this Community lives underneath the Covenant and scope of the original instance of 1Hive. This Covenant can be viewed here: https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0x8ccbeab14b5ac4a431fffc39f4bec4089020a155/covenant 1Hive's v1 Garden has authority over the Common Pool funding this v2 Community receives.

### Forkability:
This Community exists in the permissionless Honey token ecosystem on Gardens v2. Anyone is free to fork this Community within the Honey ecosystem of Gardens v2 by creating a new Community with its own Covenant, Council Safe, and Community settings.

#### Active Contributors Rewards

The goal of this pool is to distribute Honey—1Hive's governance token—to members who actively create value for the community. By doing so, 1Hive aims to:

Reward valuable contributions to encourage continued efforts from members.

Distribute ownership within the community to those who actively support the Covenant.

Enhance collective decision-making by empowering engaged contributors.

How It Works:

Anyone contributing to 1Hive is invited and encouraged to create a proposal. The Council Safe will establish Superfluid streams to proposal creators based on the proposal's Conviction.

Creating a Proposal:

To help voters make an informed allocation, include the following in your proposal:

Who you are: provide a brief introduction.

Your active contributions: detail your active work and impact within the 1Hive community.

Your goals and vision: share your objectives and long-term plans for 1Hive.

Feel free to link: to a forum post or discussion thread where you regularly update this information.

Important Guidelines:

This pool is designed to support others' proposals based on their contributions, not your own.

Supporting your own proposal violates the community's trust and is subject of dispute.

Be diligent in adding or removing your support to ensure accurate distribution values.

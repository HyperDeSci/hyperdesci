This is the xMEGAPI token, created to summon [CCGF](https://hyperdesci.gitbook.io/ccgf), -- our pre-token that will be used for first tests in governance: [0x7f8beda08fb7f1f3350d4be7f333f5a20f3247aa](https://basescan.org/token/0x7f8beda08fb7f1f3350d4be7f333f5a20f3247aa).

At this stage, the token is governed by the summoning stewards on multi-sig. 

By joining the experiment, you acknowledge that you understand that it's a high-risk experiment in governance that could lead to losses.

# HyperDeSci & $FURMION: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## 1. What's HyperDeSci all about?

HyperDeSci is an initiative that was created with the goal to explore novel ways to fund science. 

HyperDeSci’s core mission is to accelerate scientific progress through decentralized funding, addressing the inefficiencies of traditional science funding models, such as bureaucratic delays and risk-averse decision-making. 

It aims to create a sustainable, community-driven ecosystem for decentralized science (DeSci), with a long-term vision of enabling ambitious projects like an open-source lunar base to become a reality.

## 2. What's the core mission of HyperDeSci and how does $FURMION fit into it?

The core mission of HyperDeSci is to accelerate human progress by supporting scientific projects, and $FURMION is the focal point in this funding process. So instead of directly distributing usdt or Eth, we are distributing grant funds in $FURMION 

$FURMION is the memecoin that powers this mission by funding DeSci projects through the Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF). A portion of every $FURMION transaction supports a treasury that funds research, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where community participation drives scientific innovation.


## 3. How do the convertible grants work and why are they important for DeSci project launches? 

Convertible grants are a core component of HyperDeSci’s CCGF, where funded projects agree to a covenant to return value (e.g., from intellectual property or patents) to the $FURMION treasury upon success. This creates a sustainable funding cycle, as successful projects fuel future research. They are crucial for DeSci project launches because they align incentives, ensuring projects contribute back to the ecosystem, reducing reliance on one-time donations, and fostering long-term financial stability for continuous funding.


## 4. How will the projects return the value?

Right now we have several options. One option to return the value would be when the projects are issued the coin, they would have to dedicate a portion of the coins to the hyperdecide treasury and to their supporters. 
Another way is that they just buy a portion of a $FURMION, and then burn it. 
But again, as grants we are not putting a lot of obligations on those projects allowing them to start activities as fast as possible.

HyperDeSci ensures $FURMION holders benefit through the convertible grants system. Successful projects return value (e.g., from monetized intellectual property or patents) to the $FURMION treasury, increasing the ecosystem’s value. This reinvestment enhances the token’s value, rewarding holders. Additionally, the Furmion Flywheel creates a cycle where successful projects attract more community support, further driving token demand and value, aligning the interests of scientists and token holders.


## 5. What makes this streaming quadratic funding farrier than the traditional funding models? 

Traditional funding often relies on a few large donors or grants, leading to unequal impact while Quadratic funding offers a more equitable and effective, by emphasizing community participation and resource allocation aligned with collective preferences, thereby maximizing the impact of contributions.
By streaming we allow projects to focus on long-term goals

$FURMION accelerates DeSci initiatives by providing a continuous funding stream through the CCGF, bypassing slow traditional grant cycles. It enables community-driven support via SQF, amplifying small donations to fund innovative projects. The token’s treasury funds projects directly, and successful projects reinvest value, sustaining the ecosystem. By leveraging Web3’s speed and community engagement, $FURMION fosters rapid project onboarding, transparent funding, and a scalable model that supports diverse DeSci initiatives.

Streaming Quadratic Funding (SQF) is fairer than traditional funding models because it distributes funds in real-time based on community support, amplifying small contributions through matching pools. Unlike traditional models, where centralized gatekeepers prioritize safe projects, SQF empowers the community to decide funding allocation via continuous donations. The more supporters a project has, the larger the matching funds it receives, democratizing funding and giving smaller donors significant impact, thus supporting innovative, high-risk projects overlooked by bureaucratic systems.

## 6. How does your HyperDeSci make sure that a DeSci project that succeeds and mere holders also benefit in the long run?

HyperDeSci onboards projects through a structured process led by LunCo, which evaluates applications based on DeSci alignment, innovation, feasibility, and commitment to repay value. Projects must demonstrate community support via streaming $FURMION donations, ensuring alignment with community goals. Once approved, projects receive continuous funding through SQF. HyperDeSci empowers projects by providing a transparent, community-driven platform, reducing bureaucratic barriers, and offering a sustainable funding model that supports long-term success.

While those projects that succeed, would grow and return value back meaning that the price of formula on the raises and So that should become a self-reinforced flywheel, eventually providing value to all the participants through the three mechanisms like burning and ad drops.

## 7. In what ways can $FURMION accelerate the growth of decentralized science initiatives?

There are several layers of support from our side.
One way that we are supporting DeSci projects is basically we are directly distributing and streaming to them $FURMION, and the projects would be able either to exchange Firmion for other coins and use that for operations.
Because the formula should grow The project could use $FURMION and Leave the $FURMION in their treasury which would enable them to either take loans or other activities in in in a web3 and on top of pure financial support, we are providing consultancy, summarize, and business development services.

HyperDeSci aims to revolutionize science funding by creating a transparent, efficient, and community-driven ecosystem that supports high-risk, high-reward research. Its funding model seeks to deliver real-world impact through breakthroughs in fields like AI, biotech, and space exploration (e.g., enabling an open-source lunar base). 

## 8. How does your HyperDeSci plan to onboard and empower hundreds of DeSci projects in web3? 

We take it one at a time. Currently, we have already supported around 42 projects.

It's not rocket science first,  projects just need to go to our website (hyperdesci.xyz)[https://hyperdesci.xyz] and click on the apply button, fill a simple application and after that our team will reach those projects that applied.

Researchers must first engage their communities to raise $FURMION donations or votes, streamed to demonstrate support. They then apply through LunCo, which evaluates projects for DeSci alignment, innovation, feasibility, and covenant commitment. Approved projects enter the SQF pool for continuous funding based on community support. Support includes access to a transparent funding stream, community backing, and the potential for sustained financial support, freeing researchers from traditional grant-writing burdens.

## 9. What real-world impact does HyperDeSci HyperDeci aim to create through its funding model?

Our core impact is to provide support for those early-stage startup projects with a focus on decentralized science startups.
And with the way we do that, it's super easy to get initial support. And that support would be done continuously, meaning that you'll be able to plan your resources and focus on your growth.

Community governance in HyperDeSci is facilitated through conviction voting and xMEGAPI tokens. The community continuously votes on projects, with votes gaining strength over time, signaling which projects deserve funding.

In Streaming Quadratic Funding (SQF), community members stream $FURMION to projects, and the volume of support determines the matching funds from the treasury. While LunCo ensures project quality, xMEGAPI holders influence funding allocation, balancing centralized quality control with decentralized decision-making.

## 10. What role does community governance play in the distribution of funds via streaming QF?

The community is directly involved in funds distribution for the projects.we heavily rely on community feedback, what projects to support. Also, the community, especially those projects community, would directly decide how the projects would be, what portion of the funds the project would get. Later, once we  establish all the operations, we will rely on the completely decentralized way to select which projects would get the support via voting.

HyperDeSci balances memecoin culture with serious scientific goals by leveraging the engaging, viral nature of memecoins (embodied by Professor Furmion, a cyberpunk cat mascot) to attract community participation, while grounding the project in a robust funding framework (CCGF). The playful narrative draws in Web3 enthusiasts, but the focus on convertible grants, SQF, and LunCo’s rigorous project selection ensures funds support impactful science. This blend makes science funding accessible and appealing without compromising credibility.

## 11. How does your HyperDeSci balance the meme culture with the serious scientific funding goals?

Most of the people behind HyperDeSci are scientists from different fields. And the way, and  how HyperDSI works, we almost instantly provide support for those projects and we will have the projects to return the value back to their supporters almost instantly and those supporters would be able to support more projects.

In five years, DeSci and HyperDeSci could significantly disrupt traditional science funding by offering a scalable, community-driven alternative. HyperDeSci’s vision, as outlined, includes supporting hundreds of projects through the $FURMION-powered CCGF, potentially funding breakthroughs in AI, biotech, and space exploration (e.g., an open-source lunar base). By streamlining funding, reducing bureaucracy, and aligning incentives, HyperDeSci could rival traditional institutions, especially for high-risk, innovative projects. However, it may complement rather than fully replace traditional systems, as scaling to match large institutional budgets and ensuring regulatory compliance remain challenges. Success will depend on community adoption, project outcomes, and robust security measures.

## 12. Some people think that the meme coins are just hype and won't last cause if I talk about the previous meme coin actually, so why should anyone believe that the $FURMION can make a real impact in science?

FURMION is designed with a clear purpose: to fund and support scientific initiatives. Its backing by real-world assets and community engagement ensures it has a sustainable impact beyond mere hype.
We have already conducted and provided support to around 42 projects. And some of those projects, they have successful TGEs, people can find reports on our GitHub, in the repository, there are links to all the projects and all the transactions with the support that we've made. $FURMION is not just a new meme coin, it's a carefully engineered coin to provide the next iteration of grants support.

Unlike typical memecoins driven by hype, $FURMION is purpose-built to fund DeSci through a sustainable model. Its Continuous Convertible Grants Framework (CCGF) ensures long-term viability by reinvesting project successes into the treasury, unlike one-off token pumps. $FURMION’s integration of Streaming Quadratic Funding and community governance amplifies small contributions, democratizing science funding. By aligning financial incentives with scientific progress and leveraging Web3’s transparency, $FURMION offers a credible mechanism to drive tangible scientific impact, far beyond speculative hype.
